## [Project Requirements](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/4/filter/more/)
1. Implement functions such that a user can apply grayscale, reflection, blur, or edge detection filters to their images.
   * The function ```grayscale``` should take an image and turn it into a black-and-white version of the same image.

   * The ```reflect``` function should take an image and reflect it horizontally.

   * The ```blur``` function should take an image and turn it into a box-blurred version of the same image.

   * The ```edges``` function should take an image and highlight the edges between objects, according to the Sobel operator.
