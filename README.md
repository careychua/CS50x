## [Project Requirements](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/4/filter/less/)
1. Implement functions such that a user can apply grayscale, sepia, reflection, or blur filters to their images.
   * The function ```grayscale``` should take an image and turn it into a black-and-white version of the same image.
  
   * The function ```sepia``` should take an image and turn it into a sepia version of the same image.

   * The ```reflect``` function should take an image and reflect it horizontally.

   * The ```blur``` function should take an image and turn it into a box-blurred version of the same image.
