# CS50x Project
## Python: Cash

---

## [Project Requirements](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/6/cash/)
1. The program asks the user how much change is owed and then spits out the minimum number of coins with which said change can be made.

2. Assume that the only coins available are quarters (25¢), dimes (10¢), nickels (5¢), and pennies (1¢).

3. If the user fails to provide a non-negative value, your program should re-prompt the user for a valid amount again and again until the user complies.
