## [Project Requirements](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/6/mario/more/)
1. The program recreates these half-pyramids using hashes (#) for blocks.

2. Prompt the user for the half-pyramidâ€™s height, a positive integer between ```1``` and ```8```, with a gap of size ```2``` separating them.

3. If the user fails to provide a positive integer no greater than ```8```, you should re-prompt for the same again.
