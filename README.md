## [Project Requirements](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/4/recover/)
1. Implement a program that recovers JPEGs from a forensic image.

2. The program should accept exactly one command-line argument, the name of a forensic image from which to recover JPEGs.

3. If the program is not executed with exactly one command-line argument, it should remind the user of correct usage, and ```main``` should return ```1```.

4. If the forensic image cannot be opened for reading, the program should inform the user as much, and ```main``` should return ```1```.

5. The program, if it uses malloc, must not leak any memory.
