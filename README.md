# CS50x Project
## Python: Crack
Implement a program that cracks passwords

---

## [Project Requirements](https://docs.cs50.net/2019/x/psets/6/sentimental/crack/crack.html)
1. Design and implement a program that cracks passwords.

2. The program should accept a single command-line argument: a hashed password.

3. If the program is executed without any command-line arguments or with more than one command-line argument, the program should print an error and exit immediately.

4. The program must proceed to crack the given password, print the password followed by ```\n```.

5. Assume that each password has been hashed with Câ€™s DES-based (not MD5-based) ```crypt``` function.

6. Assume that each password is no longer than five (5) characters. 

7. Assume that each password is composed entirely of alphabetical characters (uppercase and/or lowercase).
