## [Project Requirements](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/6/credit/)
1. The program prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports (via ```print```) whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number.

2. Assume that the user’s input will be entirely numeric (i.e., devoid of hyphens, as might be printed on an actual card).
