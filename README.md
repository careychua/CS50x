# CS50x Project
## C Language: Plurality
Implement a program that runs a plurality election.

---

## [Project Reequirements](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/3/plurality/)
1. Complete the implementation such that the program simulates a plurality vote election.

2. Complete the ```vote``` function.
   * ```vote``` takes a single argument, a ```string``` called ```name```, representing the name of the candidate who was voted for.

   * If ``name`` matches one of the names of the candidates in the election, then update that candidateâ€™s vote total to account for the new vote. The ```vote``` function in this case should return ```true``` to indicate a successful ballot.

   * If ```name``` does not match the name of any of the candidates in the election, no vote totals should change, and the ```vote``` function should return ```false``` to indicate an invalid ballot.

   * Assume that no two candidates will have the same name.

3. Complete the ```print_winner``` function.
   * The function should print out the name of the candidate who received the most votes in the election, and then print a newline.

   * It is possible that the election could end in a tie if multiple candidates each have the maximum number of votes. In that case, you should output the names of each of the winning candidates, each on a separate line.
