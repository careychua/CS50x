# CS50x Project
## C Language: Cash
Implement a program that asks the user how much change is owed and then prints the minimum number of coins with which that change can be made.

## [Project Requirements](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/1/cash/)
1. Assume that the only coins available are quarters (25¢), dimes (10¢), nickels (5¢), and pennies (1¢). 
2. If the user fails to provide a non-negative value, your program should re-prompt the user for a valid amount again and again until the user complies.
