# CS50x Project
## Python: Credit

## Project Requirements
1. The program prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports (via ```print```) whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number.

2. Assume that the userâ€™s input will be entirely numeric (i.e., devoid of hyphens, as might be printed on an actual card).
