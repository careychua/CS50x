# CS50x Project
## Python: Readability

---

## [Project Requirements](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/6/readability/)
1. The program that asks the user to type in some text, and then outputs the grade level for the text, according to the Coleman-Liau formula.

2. The program should count the number of letters, words, and sentences in the text. You may assume that a letter is any lowercase character from ```a``` to ```z``` or any uppercase character from ```A``` to ```Z```, any sequence of characters separated by spaces should count as a word, and that any occurrence of a period, exclamation point, or question mark indicates the end of a sentence.

3. The program should print as output "Grade X" where X is the grade level computed by the Coleman-Liau formula, rounded to the nearest integer.

4. If the resulting index number is 16 or higher (equivalent to or greater than a senior undergraduate reading level), your program should output ```Grade 16+``` instead of giving the exact index number. If the index number is less than 1, your program should output ```Before Grade 1```.
